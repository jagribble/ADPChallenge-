***Authenitcation Pattern:***

1. If the web app is configured to allow unauthenticated access, requests from the browser are allowed without any authentication.
2. If the web app is configured to require authentication, the userâ€™s browser is redirected to the associated Salesforce.com org for authentication.

***Prerequisites:***

Clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/EliLillyCo/CIRR_EXPRESS_HANDLEBARS_AUTH).

A Force.com Connected App is required to implement this accelerator. Please submit a Service Request to the Cirrus team to request a Connected App be created, specifying your app name and Application URL.

Add the [Heroku Redis] (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis) and [New Relic APM] (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/newrelic) add-ons to your Heroku application. [Papertrail] (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/papertrail) is also recommended, not not required.
